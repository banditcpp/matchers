matchers
========

An assertion library for C++11

Matchers is a header-only C++11 assertion framework having similarities to

  * RSpec Expectations (for Ruby),
  * Cedar Matchers (for Swift, Obj-C, ...),
  * ScalaTest Matchers (for Scala).

It was originally developed by Brandon Fosdick as part of
[Bandit](http://github.com/banditcpp/bandit)
and has been extracted to be usable in other contexts.
